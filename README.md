## Selection stuff

> In addition, you can also expand your selection using pattern searches.

> For example, `v/foo` will select from your current position to the next instance of "foo." If you actually wanted to > expand to the next instance of "foo," on line 35, for example, just press `n` to expand selection to the next instance, and so on.

> I don't often do it, but I know that some people use marks extensively to make visual selections. For example, if I'm on line 5 and I want to select to line 35, I might press `ma` to place mark a on line 5, then `:35` to move to line 35. `Shift + v` to enter linewise visual mode, and finally ``a` to select back to mark `a`.
